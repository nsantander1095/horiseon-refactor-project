## Description
[Link to live site.](https://nsantander1095.github.io/horiseon-refactor-project/)

To walk through the required accpetance criteria for the refactor ticket on the Horiseon website; firstly, the SEO link at the top of the page now works as intended, as does all of the header links. Next, every instance of non semantic elements in the index.html file has been changed to an appropriately descrpitive semantic element. Next, the stylesheet in CSS has been consolidated to omit redundances and altered to mirror the changes made in the index.html file. 

## Visuals
As you can see in the screenshot below, the live website looks identical to the mockup.
